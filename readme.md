                                Practice Problem map(), filter(), find()
1) You have an odd array (array with odd numbers). [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ].
Now convert this array into an even array (array with even
numbers). [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]. Do this using for loop & array.map()
method. Hints: add one to any odd number and it will become an even
number.

2) You are given an array say: [33, 50, 79, 78, 90, 101, 30 ]. Now
return/get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using
array.filter() method.

3) Now do the same task of question 2. But do this using array.find()
method. Then compare the output of question 2 & question 3.

                                Practice Problem reduce()
1) You have an array [ 1, 9, 17, 22 ]. Add the all elements
of this array and give output. Do this using for loop &
array.reduce() method.
